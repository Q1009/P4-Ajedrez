"""
Utilities to generate and manage tournament match pairings and results.

This module provides:
- generate_first_round_matches(players): produce randomized first-round pairings.
- generate_round_matches(players, previous_matches): produce pairings for subsequent rounds
  using score groups and avoiding previous pairings when possible.
- inscribe_match_results(match, result1): write a match result (from white player's POV).

Note: match representations used across the app are kept simple and serializable:
    match = ([white_id, white_score], [black_id, black_score])
Previous matches are tracked as a list of two-item lists: [[p1, p2], ...].

    Generate pairings for a subsequent round.

    Strategy:
    - Group players by their current points.
    - Within each score group shuffle players to avoid deterministic ordering.
    - Attempt to pair players with the same (or nearest) score while avoiding
      pairings that already occurred (tracked in previous_matches).
    - If no eligible opponent is found for a player, that player remains unpaired
      for this round (caller may handle by giving bye or other rules).

    Parameters
    ----------
    players : dict
        Mapping player_id -> points (float).
    previous_matches : list
        Mutable list of previously paired id pairs, e.g. [[p1, p2], ...].
        This list will be appended with newly created pairs.

    Returns
    -------
    matches : list of tuple
        Newly generated matches in the format ([white_id, ""], [black_id, ""]).

    Record the result of a match given the white player's result.

    The function expects `match` to be mutable (lists) and sets both players'

    Parameters
    ----------
    match : tuple of lists
        Match representation: ([white_id, white_score], [black_id, black_score]).

    -------
    match : tuple of lists
        The same match structure with updated numeric scores (floats).

    -----
    - If an invalid value is provided, the function prints an error message and
      leaves the match unchanged.
